In this How to Decide book summary, we&apos;ll summarise some of the book&apos;s key highlights.</p><p><em><strong>If you are someone who takes a long time to make a minor decision, you will be branded indecisive, and if you always go with your gut feeling and don&apos;t take time to analyse the big decisions, you will be impressed as rash and careless, and very few rash or indecisive people are successful.<br>Great decision-makers know when to go quick and when to slow down to gather more information. In How to Decide, Anne Duke shows you how to craft decision-making processes to avoid being rash or indecisive.</strong></em></p><blockquote>Spot a Sheep in Wolf&apos;s Clothing: A decision that seems more impactful than it actually is. Decide quickly if a decision passes ANY of these three tests:</blockquote><ul><li><strong><em><u>The Happiness Test:</u></em></strong> You&apos;re at a restaurant, and you are agonising over what to order, and you finally figure out what you want, and you hate it. How much of an effect will the food you ate that night have on your happiness over the course of a week? The average person&apos;s time deciding what to eat, watch and wear adds up to 250 to 275 hours per year. That&apos;s a lot of time spent on decisions that will have little impact on your happiness a week from now. <em>The next time you&apos;re stuck on a decision, conduct The Happiness Test by asking yourself: &quot;Will this decision impact my happiness a week from now?&quot; If not, decide quickly.</em></li><li><strong><em><u>The Only Option Test:</u></em></strong> Most decisions are threshold problems: gather options and determine which options meet your standards (which are satisfactory and not). However, once you have two or more options that meet your criteria, the decision is easy &#x2010; pick one. Spending hours to determine which option is best is usually a waste of your time. If a vacation to Destination A has a 90% chance of being a great vacation, but a vacation to Destination B might have a 91% chance of being a great vacation, stop wasting your time and flip a coin. The faster you pick, the more time you&#x2019;ll have to prepare for your vacation.</li><li><strong><em><u>The Two-Way Door test:</u></em></strong> &#xA0;Decisions, where the cost to quit, is manageable also allow you to gather information through innovation and experimentation. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Virgin Group founder Richard Branson include the concept of a &#x201C;two-way-door&#x201D; decision in their decision process.</li></ul><blockquote>&#x201C;Some decisions are one&#x2010;way doors... If you walk through and don&apos;t like what you see on the other side, you can&apos;t get back to where you were before. But most decisions aren&apos;t like that &#x2010; they are changeable, reversible &#x2010; they&apos;re two&#x2010;way doors. If you&apos;ve made a sub&#x2010;optimal two&#x2010;way door decision, you don&apos;t have to live with the consequences for that <br>long. You can reopen the door and go back through.&#x201D; &#x2013; Jeff Bezos</blockquote><p><br>Determine if a decision is a two&#x2010;way door decision by routinely asking yourself: &#x201C;What is the cost of quitting?&#x201D; If the cost of quitting is low, decide quickly.</p><p><strong>Often, you will face high-impact, one-way-door decisions that carry a high cost to unwind (like buying a house, or moving to another country, or changing professions). When you know that you have such a decision on the horizon, you need to go slow, collect information, and construct target estimates.</strong><br>First, quantify a successful outcome. If you decide to change jobs, success might be the number of years you expect to work at the new company. Once you have a success metric in mind, construct a target &#x2013; the bullseye is your &#x201C;best (educated) guess,&#x201D; and the width of the target is the space between your upper and lower estimate (upper and lower bounds). For example, if you think you&#x2019;ll stay five years at the new job but believe you could stay as long as ten years and as little as three months, your upper bound is ten years, and you are lower bound is three months. Determine the upper and lower bound for any estimate by conducting The Shock Test. Ask yourself: &#x201C;Would I be shocked if the result was higher than my upper bound and lower than my lower bound?&#x201D;<br>Search for information that will refine your target: adjust your upper bound, lower bound, and best guess. There will come the point when you need to stop researching and estimating and make a decision. As Jeff Bezos says:</p><blockquote><br>&#x201C;Most decisions should probably be made with somewhere around 70% of the information you wish you had.&#x201D;</blockquote>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Book-Summary -> Drive: The Surprising Truth about What Motivates Us.]]></title><description><![CDATA[<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-full kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1520970014086-2208d157c9e2?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDF8fGJvb2slMjBzdW1tYXJ5fGVufDB8fHx8MTYxODAzOTg2OA&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=2000" class="kg-image" alt="Grid notebook and Muji pen" loading="lazy" width="3000" height="2000" srcset="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1520970014086-2208d157c9e2?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDF8fGJvb2slMjBzdW1tYXJ5fGVufDB8fHx8MTYxODAzOTg2OA&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=600 600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1520970014086-2208d157c9e2?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDF8fGJvb2slMjBzdW1tYXJ5fGVufDB8fHx8MTYxODAzOTg2OA&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=1000 1000w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1520970014086-2208d157c9e2?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDF8fGJvb2slMjBzdW1tYXJ5fGVufDB8fHx8MTYxODAzOTg2OA&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=1600 1600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1520970014086-2208d157c9e2?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDF8fGJvb2slMjBzdW1tYXJ5fGVufDB8fHx8MTYxODAzOTg2OA&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=2400 2400w"><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@kellysikkema?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">Kelly Sikkema</a> / <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>In &quot;Drive: The Surprising Truth about What Motivates Us&quot;, Daniel Pink draws on four decades of scientific research to reveal the elements of true motivation &#x2013; autonomy, mastery, and purpose.

In this Drive book summary, we&apos;ll summarise some of the book&apos;s key highlights, with an overview of ingredients for intrinsic motivation.</p><blockquote><strong><em>What is the best way to motivate yourself and others to do cognitively demanding work?</em></strong></blockquote><p>External rewards like cash bonuses are great for straightforward tasks:</p><ul><li>Getting kids to try to do their chores.</li><li>Convincing yourself to try to do repetitive data entry work.</li></ul><p>However, these &apos;if you do this, I&apos;ll reward you with that&apos; sorts of external incentives are horrible for motiving yourself and others to find out a difficult subject or come up with creative solutions to complex problems.</p><blockquote><strong>The best way to motivate yourself and others is to spark the three intrinsic drivers:</strong></blockquote><ul><li><strong><em><u>AUTONOMY</u></em></strong>: When Atlassian, an Australian software company, allowed their programmers to have an entire day of freedom (they were paid to work on whatever code they wanted with whomever they wanted), they came up with several new product ideas and dozens of creative solutions to existing problems. Atlassian co&#x2010;founder Mike Cannon&#x2010;Brookes told author Daniel Pink, &quot;If you don&apos;t pay enough, you can lose people. But beyond that, money is not a motivator.&quot; What motivates people beyond equal pay is work autonomy. By giving yourself and others a degree of flexibility within a rigid framework with a choice of tasks, free time to work on side projects, choice of technique, and the opportunity to pick team members, you will spark the intrinsic drive of autonomy. Author Daniel Pink calls these the four T&apos;s of autonomy: freedom to choose the task, the time, the technique, and the team.</li></ul><blockquote><em>&quot;Control leads to compliance; autonomy leads to engagement.&quot; &#x2010; Daniel Pink</em>.</blockquote><ul><li><strong><em><u>MASTERY</u></em></strong>: When Swedish shipping company, Green Cargo, wanted to overhaul their performance review process, they implemented a key finding by psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi: when workers are given tasks slightly above their current skill level and stay in a state between boredom and anxiety, they are more engaged, more motivated to work, and more creative. Green Cargo implemented Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi&apos;s findings by changing the way they conducted performance reviews. During each performance review, managers now needed to determine if their employees were overwhelmed or underwhelmed with their current work assignments. The managers needed to work with each employee to craft Goldilocks work assignments: work assignments that weren&apos;t too hard, not too easy, but just right above their current skill level. What effect did Green Cargo&apos;s new performance review system have? Employees were more engaged and reported feelings of mastery over their work. After two years of these recent performance reviews, Green Cargo became profitable for the first time in 125 years.</li></ul><blockquote><em>&quot;One source of frustration in the workplace is the frequent mismatch between what people must do and what people can do. When what they must do exceeds their capabilities, the result is anxiety. When what they must do falls short of their capabilities, the result is boredom. But when the match is just right, the results can be glorious.&quot; &#x2010; Daniel Pink</em>.</blockquote><ul><li><strong><em><u>PURPOSE</u></em></strong>: &quot;You have to repeat your mission and your purpose...over and over and over. And sometimes you&apos;re like, doesn&apos;t everyone already know this? It doesn&apos;t matter. Starting out the meetings with This is Facebook&apos;s mission, This is Instagram&apos;s mission, and This is why WhatsApp exists (is critical).&quot; &#x2013; Sheryl Sandberg When Sheryl Sandburg starts her meetings by stating the mission, she&apos;s sparking the third intrinsic driver: a sense of purpose. The purpose is why organisations like &apos;Doctors Without Borders&apos; can get highly skilled doctors to willingly travel to poor villages around the world, live in harsh conditions, and get paid very little money to do so. These doctors are motivated to work because they are fuelled by a sense of purpose they get from helping others.</li></ul><blockquote><em>&quot;Human beings have an innate inner drive to be autonomous, self&#x2010;determined, and connected to one another. And when that drive is liberated, people achieve more and live richer lives.&quot; &#x2010; Daniel Pink</em>.</blockquote>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
